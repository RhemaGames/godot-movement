Scripts to help setup different movement profiles for kinematicBodies

# Usage:

Once you have your project started checkout this respository and attach the script(s) to your project.

Each script should be self explanatory but here is a brief discription of each:

1. General: Basic input functions tied to input actions.
2. 3rd Person: Base input controls for 3rd person games
3. Flight Simple: Arcade style flight controls.

Will update with more detailed information later.
